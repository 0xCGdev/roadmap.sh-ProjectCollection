## 🧠 About
This repository documents my learning journey to become a **Full Stack Developer** through the projects and exercises from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).  
Each project helps me build a deeper understanding of both frontend and backend development — from mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to learning databases, APIs, and server-side technologies.

More projects will be added as I continue progressing through different stages of the roadmap.
